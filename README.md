# WeatherApp

Front-End (React):

Setup:

Create a new React application using a tool like Create React App.
Set up your project structure and components.
User Interface:

Create a user interface for users to enter the location (city name or coordinates) to fetch weather data.
Display the current weather conditions, temperature, and humidity once data is retrieved.
API Integration:

Choose a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, or AccuWeather).
Obtain an API key by signing up with the chosen provider.
Implement API requests in your React application to fetch weather data based on user input.
Responsive Design:

Use CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap or Material-UI) to ensure your application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for API requests (e.g., display an error message if the location is not found or if there's an issue with the API).
Testing:

Test your React components to ensure they function as expected.
Back-End (Node.js with Express):

Setup:

Set up a new Node.js project.
Install Express and other required dependencies.
API Proxy:

Create a route in your Express application to act as a proxy for the weather API requests from your React app.
Use the axios library (or a similar library) to make API requests to the weather API.
API Key Management:

Store your weather API key securely (using environment variables or a configuration file).
Never expose your API key directly in your codebase.
Response Formatting:

Process the data received from the weather API and send a well-formatted response to your React app

For the Front-End (React):

Make sure your React development server is running:

In your React project directory, run npm start to start the development server.
Check the console output for any errors or messages indicating that the server is up and running.
Check the URL in your browser:

Ensure that you're accessing the correct URL in your browser. It should be http://localhost:3000 by default for a React development server.
For the Back-End (Node.js with Express):

Verify that your Express server is running:

Run your Express server using the appropriate command (e.g., node server.js).
Check the console output for any errors or messages indicating that the server has started.
Ensure the correct port and URL in your code:

Double-check that the Express server is listening on the correct port (e.g., 3001) as specified in your code and launch configuration.
Make sure that your API route is correctly defined in your Express server and matches the route in your React front-end.
